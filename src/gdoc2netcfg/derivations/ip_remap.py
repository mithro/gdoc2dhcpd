"""IPv4 site remapping: resolve site-templated addresses and filter by site.

Spreadsheets shared across sites use 'X' as a placeholder in the second
octet of IPv4 addresses (e.g. 10.X.10.100) for devices that exist at
every site.  This module resolves those placeholders to the current site's
octet (e.g. 10.2.10.100 for monarto where site_octet=2).

Records may also carry a 'site' column.  When non-empty it must match
the current site name; records for other sites are filtered out.
